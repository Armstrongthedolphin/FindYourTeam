List of Feautures (ideas)
-Register Project 
 Project Name, Name, Project Description, Desired Skills
  (We need to think of how we want to store the desired skills info in a way that other users can later search "skills" in order to find a    project that they're interested in/qualified for) ---maybe a really thorough list of skills?
****It could be good to get our home page working first with maybe one feature, "make new project"
